Requirement:
There is a group of monkeys who eat a pile of peaches.
On Day 1, they eat half plus 1
On Day 2, they eat half plus 1 again
...
On Day 10, they notice there is only 1 peach left before they eat.

Question:
1) How many peaches in total in Day 1?
2) Print out from Day 1, how many peaches in total? How many peaches they eat? How many peaches are left. Till last day.
'''

'''
Code Logic:
1) To calculate the 1st day, till the 10th day -> I should use 'for' loop, loop in range(9,0,-1)

2) On each day, there are 3 numbers:
   a) How many peaches in total at first? -> define a new variable peach_total
   b) How many peaches the monkey eat?    -> define a new variable peach_eaten
   c) How many peaches are left           -> define a new variable peach_left
   -> peach_total = peach_eaten + peach_left
   
3) On 10th day, before monkey eat, they notice there is only 1 peach left
   -> 
   day 9:
   peach_left = 1
   peach_total = (peach_left + 1) * 2
   
   day 8:
   peach_left(day 8) = peach_total(day 9) 
   peach_total = (peach_left + 1) * 2
   
   day 7:
   peach_left(day 7) = peach_total(day 8) 
   peach_total = (peach_left + 1) * 2
   ... 
       
'''

# There is 1 peach left in day 10
peach_total = 1

for day in range(9,0,-1):
    peach_left = peach_total   # we are looping backwards. Day 10's peach_total is Day 9's peach_left
    peach_total = (peach_left + 1) * 2

print(f"On day 1, there are {peach_total} peaches before they eat.") #Question 1) is done!

print("------------------------------------------------")

# Question 2)
for day in range(1,10):
    peach_eaten = (peach_total // 2) + 1
    peach_left = peach_total - peach_eaten
    print(f"On Day {day}, there are {peach_total} peaches initially. They eat {peach_eaten} peaches, and there are {peach_left} peaches left.")

    # And now peach left becomes next day's peach total
    # Updat peach_total, so that the for loop for proceed.
    peach_total = peach_left
